## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS preprocessor
- Javascript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- What a good challenge! I finished a lot faster than the others, I think that means I'm evolving my skills. 
The result is good, in some places I invented logic, because of reaction logic and methodology. It was the first time I used
useEffect hook, so if something is wrong there, feedback welcome! Thanks for reading and until next app!
